 Task-02: Sudoku Solver

 Description:
This project implements a Sudoku Solver using Java.  
The program automatically solves a 9×9 Sudoku puzzle using the
backtracking algorithm.

 Technologies Used:
- Java
- Backtracking Algorithm
- 2D Arrays

 Algorithm Used:
The backtracking technique is used to try possible numbers in empty
cells. If a number violates Sudoku rules, the algorithm backtracks
and tries a different number until the puzzle is solved.

Input:
A partially filled 9×9 Sudoku grid where empty cells are represented
by 0.

Output:
The completed Sudoku grid is displayed after solving the puzzle.

Project Files:
- `SudokuSolver.java` – Java source code for solving Sudoku
- `README.md` – Project documentation

How to Run:
```bash
javac SudokuSolver.java
java SudokuSolver
